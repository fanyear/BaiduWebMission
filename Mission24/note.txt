Success
There is no doubt that if you ask people whether they want to be successful,most will say yes.
It is true that most of the people  dreaming of  being successful.But it is also true that not
 everyone will succeed.So let's talk about what does success depend on? Some people hold a view
 that success depends on talents and intelligence.For example,Edison,with an IQ of  at least
 160,invented light which brings light to the world,making a big progess of society.Moreover,
 he had more than 2 thousand inventions which made him famous and successful.
However,other people suggest that success depends on personalities which includes patience ,
hard work ,determination.For one thing, chef Chen,from Malaysia,learned to cook at the age of
 15 years old.He had insisted on cooking for more that 20 years.Because of his insistance,he
  won Michelin award which is a great honour for a  chef.For another thing,if you love basketball,
  you will konw a name,Kobe Brayant.Importantly,you also has heard about his words," Have you ever
  seen Los Angeles at 4 am " .He is a famous and successful basketball player,depending on his
  hard work.
  As for me,I support the opinion of Nicholas Tse who thinks that Success depends on how much you want
  to be successful.If you walk in the street and ask the people do they want to be successful,most of
  people will say yes.But not all of them will succeed.Why?You can ask yourself,do you want to be successful
  rather than sleeping in the bed? do you want to be successful rather than  watching TV or handing out with
   friends ? Nicholas Tse really loves action movies and give his lifetime to it,which makes him successful.
